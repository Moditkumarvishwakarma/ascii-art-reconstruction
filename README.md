🎨 ASCII ART RECONSTRUCTION
==========================

👋 About the Project
-------------------
This project is about creating an ASCII art image using Python.
Instead of using any ready-made patterns, the image is built by
deciding which character should appear at each row and column.

The idea behind this project is to understand how text-based
images work and how simple logic can be used to draw pictures
inside the terminal.


📁 Project Files
---------------
📄 ascii.py  
    The main Python file. It contains the logic that prints the
    ASCII art using row and column conditions.

📄 ascii_art.txt  
    Stores the final ASCII art output.

🖼️ diego_maradona.jpg  
    The original image used as a reference while creating the
    ASCII version.

📄 .gitignore  
    Used to ignore unnecessary files in the Git repository.

📄 README.md 
    This file explains the project and how to run it.


⚙️ How the Program Works
-----------------------
🔹 The program goes through rows and columns one by one  
🔹 For each position, it checks conditions and picks a character  
🔹 Characters are combined to form a full line  
🔹 Each line is printed to the terminal  
🔹 All lines together form the ASCII image  


▶️ How to Run
------------
1️⃣ Open a terminal or command prompt  
2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder  
3️⃣ Run the command:

   python ascii.py


🖨️ Output
---------
✨ When the program runs, it prints a 52-row ASCII art image in
the terminal.

📄 The same output can also be saved in `ascii_art.txt`.


📚 What You Learn from This Project
---------------------------------
✔ Working with nested loops  
✔ Using `if` and `elif` conditions effectively  
✔ Understanding text-based image rendering  
✔ Practicing Git and GitHub workflow
